# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
VeilPix is an AI-powered image editing React web application that uses Google's Gemini AI model for generative image editing. The app provides localized photo editing, global filters, adjustments, and cropping capabilities through an intuitive web interface.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 19 with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool
- **Backend API**: Node.js/Express server with authentication, usage tracking, and billing
- **AI Service**: Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview`) for image generation via backend
- **Authentication**: Clerk for user management and session handling
- **Database**: Supabase for usage tracking, billing records, and user data
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe for billing and usage metering
- **State Management**: React hooks with local state (no external state library)
- **Image Processing**: Canvas API for cropping, react-image-crop for crop selection
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom animations and gradients

## Development Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Environment Setup
Create a `.env.local` file with:
```
# Legacy: Gemini API key (now used in backend only)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Clerk Configuration (Required)
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key

# API Configuration (Required - MUST use 127.0.0.1 in WSL environments)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3001

# Optional: Environment
VITE_NODE_ENV=development
```

### WSL Development Environment Notes
- **Critical**: When developing in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), you MUST use `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` for API connections
- **Frontend Access**: Access the frontend at `http://127.0.0.1:5173/` instead of `http://localhost:5173/`
- **Backend API**: Backend must be configured to listen on `0.0.0.0:3001` and allow CORS from both localhost and 127.0.0.1 origins
- **Networking Issue**: JavaScript fetch requests from `localhost:5173` to `localhost:3001` may fail in WSL, but `127.0.0.1:5173` to `127.0.0.1:3001` works reliably

## Key Components Structure
- `App.tsx` - Main application with image editing state management and history
- `src/services/apiClient.ts` - HTTP client for backend API communication
- `src/hooks/useImageGeneration.ts` - React hooks for AI image generation via API
- `components/FilterPanel.tsx` - Filter selection with presets and custom input
- `components/AdjustmentPanel.tsx` - Global image adjustment controls
- `components/CropPanel.tsx` - Crop functionality with aspect ratio controls
- `components/Header.tsx` - App header with usage counter
- `components/StartScreen.tsx` - Initial upload and mode selection
- `components/CompositeScreen.tsx` - Multi-image composition interface
- `veilpix-api/routes/gemini.js` - AI image generation endpoints
- `veilpix-api/routes/auth.js` - Authentication endpoints
- `veilpix-api/routes/usage.js` - Usage tracking endpoints
- `veilpix-api/middleware/auth.js` - Clerk authentication middleware
- `veilpix-api/middleware/validation.js` - Input validation for API requests

## Core Features Implementation
1. **Localized Editing**: Click-to-edit system where users click image hotspots for precise edits
2. **History Management**: Undo/redo system with image file versioning
3. **Multi-modal Interface**: Four editing modes - Retouch, Crop, Adjust, Filters
4. **Real-time Preview**: Before/after comparison with mouse press/hold

## Important Technical Details
- Images are stored as File objects in browser memory with automatic URL cleanup via useEffect
- All AI requests are processed through the backend API for security and usage tracking
- The app uses manual cropping via Canvas API rather than server-side processing
- Error handling includes specific messaging for different types of API failures
- Authentication is handled via Clerk with automatic session management
- Usage tracking and billing are integrated with Stripe for pay-per-use model

## API Integration Notes
- Backend API handles all Gemini AI requests with proper authentication and validation
- Main endpoints: `/api/gemini/generate-edit`, `/api/gemini/generate-filter`, `/api/gemini/generate-adjust`, `/api/gemini/combine-photos`
- All requests include safety guidelines to prevent inappropriate content generation
- Usage limits: 20 free requests for anonymous users, unlimited for authenticated users (billed)
- Response handling includes proper error messages and usage tracking

## Gemini AI Implementation Details
- **Model**: Uses `gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview` for all image generation and editing
- **Prompt-Based System**: All image adjustments use natural language prompts, NOT sliders or structured parameters
- **Adjustment Interface**: AdjustmentPanel provides preset prompts (e.g., "Enhance Details", "Warmer Lighting") and custom text input
- **API Request Format**: Send text prompts directly to the Gemini API along with image data
- **Response Format**: Returns base64 encoded image data in `{success: true, image: {data: "base64...", mimeType: "image/png"}}` format
- **Image Processing**: Frontend converts base64 responses back to File objects for history management

### Gemini API Response Processing
- **Consistent Response Structure**: Both single image editing and multi-image combination use the same response format
- **Response Path**: Image data is located at `response.candidates[0].content.parts[]` where each part may contain `inlineData`
- **Image Part Detection**: Use `parts.find(part => part.inlineData)` to locate the image data within the response parts array
- **Data Format**: Image data structure is `{ inlineData: { data: "base64...", mimeType: "image/png" } }`
- **Critical Note**: All Gemini image generation endpoints (single edit, filter, adjust, combine) return the same response structure with `inlineData` (not `inline_data`)
- **Processing Function**: The `processGeminiResponse()` function in `routes/gemini.js` handles response parsing for all image generation endpoints uniformly

## Critical Database Architecture Notes
- **Supabase Client**: Uses lazy loading pattern with service role key to prevent module loading failures
- **Service Role Configuration**: Backend uses `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` which automatically bypasses RLS (Row Level Security) policies
- **Database Utils**: All database functions in `utils/database.js` use `getSupabaseClient()` function instead of direct client creation
- **Route Dependencies**: Any route file that imports database utilities MUST use `const { db, supabase } = require('../utils/database')` and call `supabase()` as a function
- **API Response Format**: Usage endpoints return `{totalUsage, remainingFreeUsage, isAuthenticated}` format for frontend compatibility
- **Authentication Flow**: Frontend tries authenticated endpoint first, falls back to anonymous endpoint gracefully
- **Connection Testing**: Database connection test is available via `testConnection()` function but not run on startup to prevent delays

## Troubleshooting Notes
- **WSL Networking**: Always use `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` in WSL environments
- **CORS Issues**: Ensure backend allows both localhost and 127.0.0.1 origins in development
- **Database Hanging**: If queries hang, check RLS policies and service role configuration
- **Usage Counter Loading**: "Loading usage..." indicates network connectivity issues, not database problems
- I will start the servers on my own whenever we need to test the GUI.
